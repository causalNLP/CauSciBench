        "dataset_description": "\"This dataset comes from a randomized field experiment conducted in rural Malawi between May and August 2004, as part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). The MDICP is a long-term study involving approximately 120 villages across three districts: Rumphi, Mchinji, and Balaka. As part of the program, respondents were offered a free HIV test administered at home. To encourage participants to collect their test results, they were randomly given vouchers of varying value, redeemable at nearby voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers. Voucher amounts were determined by drawing tokens from a bag. Researchers then recorded whether participants retrieved their results from the assigned VCT center.\nVariables:\n\nsite: Region of Malawi where the study was conducted (1 = Mchinji, 2 = Balaka, 3 = Rumphi)\nrumphi: Indicator for living in Rumphi district\nbalaka: Indicator for living in Balaka district\nvillnum: Village ID\nsurvey2004: Indicator for completing the 2004 baseline survey\ngot: Indicator for whether the respondent obtained their HIV test result\nzone: Identifier for the VCT center assigned to the respondent\ndistvct: Distance (in kilometers) to the assigned VCT center\ntinc: Total incentive value in Malawi Kwacha\nTi: Discrete incentive level category (e.g., 0; 10\u201350; 60\u2013100; 110\u2013200; 210\u2013300 Malawi Kwacha)\nany: Indicator for receiving a positive-valued incentive\nunder: Indicator for living within 1.5 km of the assigned VCT center\nover: Indicator for living more than 1.5 km from the assigned VCT center\nsimaverage: Simulated average distance to a VCT center (based on randomly drawn household locations)\nage: Respondent\u2019s age in 2004\nmale: Indicator for male respondents\nhiv2004: HIV test result in 2004 (\u22121 indicates indeterminate result)\"",

Public opinion measures come from the Gallup World Poll (GWP), an annual global survey launched in 2006 that samples individuals aged 15 and older. In countries with high telephone penetration (over 80%), data are collected through Random-Digit-Dial (RDD) telephone interviews; elsewhere, surveys are conducted face-to-face. Each survey includes about 1,000 respondents per country per year.\nAid-related data include figures from the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), one of the largest U.S. bilateral health initiatives, launched in 2003 and first disbursed in 2004, aimed at combating HIV/AIDS in dozens of countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The dataset also incorporates U.S. Official Development Assistance (ODA) compiled from international aid databases.\nAdditional country-level indicators are drawn from international sources: population and economic statistics from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators (WDI), health data from UNAIDS and global monitoring agencies, governance measures from the World Bank Governance Indicators, civil liberties scores from Freedom House, UN General Assembly voting data, and trade flows from the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nData variables\n\ncountry: Country name\nccode: Numeric country code\ny_us: Net approval of the U.S. (log(%approve) \u2212 log(%disapprove))\ny_ch: Net approval of China\ny_fr: Net approval of France\ny_ge: Net approval of Germany\ny_in: Net approval of India\ny_ja: Net approval of Japan\ny_ru: Net approval of Russia\ny_uk: Net approval of the U.K.\ny_ownc: Net approval of respondent\u2019s own country\nx: PEPFAR funds per capita (log)\nx_imputed: PEPFAR funds per capita (log, imputed)\nz_ratio: HIV prevalence rate (log)\nz_death: HIV-related deaths per capita (log)\nusaid: U.S. ODA per capita (log)\nusaid_imputed: U.S. ODA per capita (log, imputed)\ngdppc: GDP per capita (log)\nwbgi: World Bank governance indicator\nfhscore: Freedom House civil liberties score\nafrica: 1 if African country, 0 otherwise\ntrade_i: Imports to the U.S. (log)\ntrade_e: Exports to the U.S. (log)\nunvote_key: UN voting alignment with the U.S.\"",

This pool was reduced to 100 by excluding outlets that had gone bankrupt, were primarily foreign-language papers, or where submissions failed.\nIn the experiment, each newspaper was randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: a pro-Obama or a pro-McCain letter to the editor.

Economic data include FDI stocks as a share of GDP, exchange rate movements, and income levels.

Due to their specific nature, earmarked funding does not offer felexibility. Thus, there is a possiblility that earmarked funding may limit organizational performances. The dataset tracks both short-term and long-term earmarked funding patterns alongside core funding levels.

The data tracks 12,530 first-year students who entered the university between the 1996-97 and 2003-04 academic years, with students aged 17-21 at entry. The dataset focuses on students whose academic performance places them near institutional academic standing thresholds, specifically those with first-year GPAs within a range of the university's academic evaluation criteria. Different campuses maintain distinct GPA cutoffs for academic standing assessments, resulting in variations in institutional policies across the university system. Students are placed on academic probation if their GPA falls below the cutoffs. The longitudinal structure captures academic performance across multiple terms and years, including semester and cumulative GPAs, total credits attempted and completed, registration patterns for fall and summer terms, and academic standing determinations.

The dataset encompasses comprehensive information on 264 of the largest cities in the United States, capturing various aspects of urban life, including organizational presence, demographic characteristics, economic conditions, and public safety indicators. The analysis draws on multiple data sources, including the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, the National Center for Charitable Statistics, and US Census data. The dataset represents one of the most comprehensive longitudinal examinations of urban organizational infrastructure and community safety patterns during a critical period in American urban development. Cities range from major metropolitan centers to smaller urban areas, providing broad geographic and demographic representation across all major US regions during the 1990s to 2010s period.\n\nVariable
