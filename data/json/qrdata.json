The researchers hypothesized that such a naming and shaming GOTV strategy would increase participation.\n\nThere are three treatment groups: Civic Duty, Hawthorne, and Neighbors. The Civic Duty group gets a message saying voting is their civic duty. The Hawthorne effect refers to the phenomenon where study subjects behave differently because they know they are being observed by researchers. Finally, the Neighbors group receives a message saying that the neighbors can become aware of whether they voted or not. The experiment also has a control group (Control), which consists of voters receiving no message. The researchers randomly assigned each voter to one of the four groups (3 types of treatment and 1 control) and examined whether the voter turnout was different across the groups.\n\nThe data is in the file social.csv.\nVariable Description\nhhsize: household size of the voter\nmessages: GOTV messages the voter received. It can be one of the three treatment groups: Civic Duty, Neighbors, Hawthorne, or the control group, Control. \nsex: sex of the voter (female or male)\nyearofbirth: year of birth of the voter\nprimary2004: whether the voter voted in the 2004 primary election (1=voted, 0=abstained)\nprimary2006: whether the voter voted in the 2006 primary election or not (1=voted, 0=abstained)",
