We focus on STIs, specifically gonorrhea, exploiting the states that legalized abortion prior to Roe v. Wade as a quasi-experiment. Using data from the CDC, we present difference-in-difference estimates showing gonorrhea incidence fell among 15–19-year-olds in early-repeal states 15–19 years after legalization. The effects are most pronounced and precisely estimated for Black women. The basic findings hold up under triple-differencing with an untreated older cohort that was not in utero during abortion repeal.},

The now-famous paper by Donohue and Levitt [2001. “The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,” 116 Quarterly Journal of Economics 379–420], linking abortion to the decline in crime in the 1990s, has shifted the focus to non-fertility outcomes. We focus on STIs, specifically gonorrhea, exploiting the states that legalized abortion prior to Roe v. Wade as a quasi-experiment. Using data from the CDC, we present difference-in-difference estimates showing gonorrhea incidence fell among 15–19-year-olds in early-repeal states 15–19 years after legalization. The effects are most pronounced and precisely estimated for Black women. The basic findings hold up under triple-differencing with an untreated older cohort that was not in utero during abortion repeal.},

Black Politicians Are More Intrinsically Motivated to Advance Blacks’ Interests: A Field Experiment Manipulating Political Incentives,"This data draws on data from a randomized field experiment in which fictional emails, appearing to come from Black constituents, were sent to legislators across the United States.

Government Transfers and Political Support,"
The data focuses on the Uruguayan Plan de Atención Nacional a la Emergencia Social (PANES), described as a large, temporary social relief program. PANES ran from April 2005 to December 2007. PANES included several components. The main part was a monthly cash transfer. Eligibility for the PANES program was determined using a predicted income score. This score was based on household socioeconomic characteristics collected during a baseline survey. Households were eligible only if their predicted income score fell below a predetermined threshold.

Don't Take 'No' For An Answer: An Experiment With Actual Organ Donor Registrations,"The state of California enacted an active-choice phrasing for their organ donation sign-up question in Q32011. Data was collected on actual organ donation registration rates in California and other U.S. states over time. The dataset includes quarterly registration rate data from California and other states for the period from Q4 2010 to Q1 2012.

Dataset Variables:

state: The state, where California is the Treated group
quarter: Quarter of observation, in ""Q""QYYYY format (Q42012 means 4th quarter of 2010)
rate: Organ donation rate
quarter_num: Quarter of observation in numerical format. 1 = Quarter 4, 2010",Did changing California's organ donation registration from opt-in to active choice in July 2011 (3rd quarter) increase donation rates compared to states that kept their existing systems?,-0.023,0.007,1,did,state,rate,,,quarter_num,,,0,,,organ_donations.csv,Table 2(1),2014,economics,MIT,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/causaldata/index.html,https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DifferenceinDifference.html?panelset_001=python-code,This needs minor pre-processing to enable canonical DiD.

 abstract = {Over 10,000 people in the U.S. die each year while waiting for an organ. Attempts to increase organ transplantation have focused on changing the registration question from an opt-in frame to an active choice frame. We analyze this change in California and show it decreased registration rates. Similarly, a ""field in the lab"" experiment run on actual organ donor registration decisions finds no increase in registrations resulting from an active choice frame. In addition, individuals are more likely to support donating the organs of a deceased who did not opt-in than one who said ""no"" in an active choice frame.},

"The Demand for, and Impact of, Learning Hiv Status.","""This dataset comes from a randomized field experiment conducted in rural Malawi between May and August 2004, as part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). The MDICP is a long-term study involving approximately 120 villages across three districts: Rumphi, Mchinji, and Balaka. As part of the program, respondents were offered a free HIV test administered at home. To encourage participants to collect their test results, they were randomly given vouchers of varying value, redeemable at nearby voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers. Voucher amounts were determined by drawing tokens from a bag. Researchers then recorded whether participants retrieved their results from the assigned VCT center.
Variables:

site: Region of Malawi where the study was conducted (1 = Mchinji, 2 = Balaka, 3 = Rumphi)
rumphi: Indicator for living in Rumphi district
balaka: Indicator for living in Balaka district
villnum: Village ID
survey2004: Indicator for completing the 2004 baseline survey
got: Indicator for whether the respondent obtained their HIV test result
zone: Identifier for the VCT center assigned to the respondent
distvct: Distance (in kilometers) to the assigned VCT center
tinc: Total incentive value in Malawi Kwacha
Ti: Discrete incentive level category (e.g., 0; 10–50; 60–100; 110–200; 210–300 Malawi Kwacha)
any: Indicator for receiving a positive-valued incentive
under: Indicator for living within 1.5 km of the assigned VCT center
over: Indicator for living more than 1.5 km from the assigned VCT center
simaverage: Simulated average distance to a VCT center (based on randomly drawn household locations)
age: Respondent’s age in 2004
male: Indicator for male respondents

The effects of rural electrification in India: An instrumental variable approach at the household level,"The dataset was collected to better understand the impacts of rural electrification at the household level, particularly in regions where electricity access was expanding but remained incomplete. The data comes from a household survey conducted across 686 households in 120 habitations in Uttar Pradesh, India.

Markets: The Fulton Fish Market,"The dataset was collected from the Fulton Fish Market, a historic wholesale fish market in New York City. The purpose of the data collection was to examine the economic and institutional dynamics of how the market functioned. Fish were sold in bulk to a wide range of buyers, including restaurants, retail shops, and independent vendors. Transactions typically took place in the early morning hours, with prices and quantities influenced by factors such as day of the week, weather conditions, and supply levels.
Sales were higher on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, compared to  Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Sellers in the market set prices individually for each customer. The dataset focuses specifically on whiting, a commonly traded fish in the market. Price information was gathered directly through daily visits to the market and from reports provided by salesmen.

Punishment and Deterrence: Evidence from Drunk Driving,"This dataset contains administrative records from the state of Washington related to driving under the influence (DUI) incidents. Washington State uniformly enforced a legal BAC limit of 0.08 for DUI offenses. The BAC values are obtained from tests conducted by the state police using breathalyzers. Drivers under the legal drinking age were excluded from the analysis, as they are subject to different legal standards. Besides BAC values, the dataset includes demographic information about the driver and recidivism, which indicates if the person was charged with a DUI offense again.
date: date when the BAC test occurred.
alcohol1: alcohol level from the first test.
alcohol2: alcohol level from the second test.
low_score: lower score between alcohol1 and alcohol2.
male: indicator for the driver’s gender; 1 if male, 0 otherwise.
white: indicator for the driver’s race; 1 if white, 0 otherwise.
recidivism: indicator for whether the driver was stopped again for suspected DUI within a specified follow-up period; 1 if yes, 0 if no.
acc: indicator for whether the original DUI stop involved a vehicle accident; 1 if yes, 0 if no.
age: age of the driver at the time of the DUI stop.

Public Trust and Collaborative Governance: An Instrumental Variable Approach,"The dataset comes from a randomized experiment, where the participant is assigned to 3 groups. In the """"Control"""" group, the subjects were provided with no information about the integrity of the government. Subjects in the """"Corrupt"""" group were shown a bar plot that showed local government officials are more corrupt than state government officials. Lastly, in the """"Honest"""" group, the subjects saw a bar plot that showed local government is less corrupt than the federal and state governments. Upon being shown the plot, subjects in the Corrupt and Honest groups were asked to record what they saw in the bar plot. Additionally, each participant across the 3 groups was asked to rate 3 statements on a scale of 1-7 (1: strongly disagree to 7: strongly agree). The statements were:
1) Local governments have the competence to provide good public programs
2) Local governments exert their best efforts to meet the needs of their citizens and
3) Local governments are honest.

Next, the subjects were asked to state their perceptions of three types of collaborative governance on a scale of 0-100 (definitely not to definitely yes):
1) Business groups should be included in the local policy decision-making process. The government-private collaboration will benefit local interests.
2) Local citizens should be included in the local policy decision-making process. The government-citizen collaboration will benefit local interests.
3) As a local citizen, are you willing to participate in your city or town government's policy decision-making processes?

Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings?,"The data come from the 1980 U.S. Census (Public Use Microdata Samples). The sample includes native-born men ages 40 to 49, corresponding to birth years 1930 through 1939. It provides information on education, weekly earnings, quarter of birth, year of birth, age in quarters, and state of birth. Earnings are constructed from annual income and weeks worked, recorded in logarithmic form.

Variables:

v1: Age in years at the time of the census.
v2: Age in quarters (used for detailed age controls).
v4: Years of completed schooling.
v5: East North Central division dummy.
v6: East South Central division dummy.
v9: Log of weekly earnings for workers with positive values.
v10: 1 if married with spouse present, 0 otherwise.
v11: Mid-Atlantic division dummy.
v12: Mountain division dummy.
v13: New England division dummy (1 if resident in New England, 0 otherwise).
v16: Census year indicator, commonly coded 70 = 1970 and 80 = 1980 in replications.
v18: Quarter of birth coded 1–4 (Q4 is the omitted category in models using q1–q3).
v19: 1 if White, 0 otherwise (primary analyses restrict to White men).
v20: 1 if in a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, 0 otherwise.
v21: South Atlantic division dummy.
v24: West North Central division dummy.

 abstract = {We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school attendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after completing less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain in school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter of birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary least squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates.},

The China Syndrome: Local Labor Market Effects of Import Competition in the United States,"This study assembles a commuting-zone panel for 1990–2007 to quantify how changes in Chinese import exposure relate to U.S. local labor-market outcomes, merging County Business Patterns, Census/ACS, and trade data to track employment, wages, nonemployment, and transfer receipts across places and time. The unit of observation is the commuting zone–year, with baseline characteristics recorded at the start of each period and subsequent changes measured over decade-length intervals.

Variables include:

czone: Commuting zone identifier.
statefip: State FIPS code for the commuting zone.
city: City/metropolitan label linked to the commuting zone.
yr: Calendar year of observation.

The effect of number of siblings and birth order on educational attainment: Empirical Evidence from Chinese General Social Survey,"The dataset originates from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), which was designed to systematically investigate social and demographic influences on education in China. It contains information at the individual, household, and regional levels, enabling analysis of how family structure and parental background shape children’s educational outcomes. Covering the period after China’s reform and opening-up, the survey integrates both family-level characteristics (e.g., number of siblings, birth order, parental education and occupation) and broader social context (e.g., urban–rural differences, regional disparities). Overall, the data provides a foundation for studying how internal family dynamics interact with external socio-economic conditions to influence educational attainment.

Can Learning Constituency Opinion Affect How Legislators Vote? Results from a Field Experiment ,"The dataset comes from a field experiment conducted on members of the New Mexico House of Representatives. The House was selected instead of the State Senate to reduce the risk of information spillovers and to take advantage of its larger chamber size. Legislators were organized into 35 matched pairs using four covariates: political party, district-level survey results, re-election status, and the 2004 presidential vote share in their district. Within each pair, one legislator was randomly assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group.
Treatment legislators received a letter describing their constituents’ opinions on a gubernatorial spending proposal involving road projects and tax rebates. The letter was mailed and verified as received on the morning the special session began, and the same content was also emailed to the treatment group. The primary outcome was the legislator’s recorded vote on the spending bill. The final sample included 67 individuals.

Doing Well by Doing Good: The Impact of Foreign Aid on Foreign Public Opinion,"The dataset combines multinational survey data on public opinion with country-level information on aid flows, health indicators, governance, and economic conditions. Public opinion measures come from the Gallup World Poll (GWP), an annual global survey launched in 2006 that samples individuals aged 15 and older. In countries with high telephone penetration (over 80%), data are collected through Random-Digit-Dial (RDD) telephone interviews; elsewhere, surveys are conducted face-to-face. Each survey includes about 1,000 respondents per country per year.
Aid-related data include figures from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), one of the largest U.S. bilateral health initiatives, launched in 2003 and first disbursed in 2004, aimed at combating HIV/AIDS in dozens of countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The dataset also incorporates U.S. Official Development Assistance (ODA) compiled from international aid databases.
Additional country-level indicators are drawn from international sources: population and economic statistics from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI), health data from UNAIDS and global monitoring agencies, governance measures from the World Bank Governance Indicators, civil liberties scores from Freedom House, UN General Assembly voting data, and trade flows from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Were Newspapers More Interested in pro-Obama Letters to the Editor in 2008? Evidence from a Field Experiment. ,"The dataset comes from an experiment on a sample of 100 U.S. daily newspapers. The initial population was drawn from the 2005 edition of Bacon’s Newspaper Directory, which listed 116 newspapers with daily circulations greater than 100,000. This pool was reduced to 100 by excluding outlets that had gone bankrupt, were primarily foreign-language papers, or where submissions failed.
In the experiment, each newspaper was randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: a pro-Obama or a pro-McCain letter to the editor. The letters were submitted by email and online forms on October 20–21, 2008. The outcome measure was whether the newspaper expressed interest in publishing the submitted letter.

"Foreign Direct Investors as Agents of Economic Transition: An Instrumental Variables Analysis
","The dataset covers 310 country-year observations from 27 transition economies in post-Soviet Europe between 1994 and 2004. It brings together indicators of institutional reform, foreign direct investment (FDI), political competition, European integration, and macroeconomic conditions to capture the dynamics of post-communist transitions.
The institutional measures are drawn from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transition indicators, which track progress on privatization, market liberalization, and structural reforms. Economic data include FDI stocks as a share of GDP, exchange rate movements, and income levels. Political developments are represented through changes in the strength of communist successor parties, constraints on executive power, and the status of relationships with the European Union (EU). The dataset also accounts for conflict conditions to capture the impact of wars on reform trajectories.

Timing Is Everything? Primacy and Recency Effects in Voter Mobilization Campaigns ,"The dataset consists of 25,000 registered voters in Rochester, New York, who were part of a randomized field experiment during the November 2005 municipal elections. Voters were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a phone reminder call scheduled for 4 weeks before Election Day, 2 weeks before, 3 days before, or a control group that received no call. The calls were nonpartisan get-out-the-vote reminders, delivered using standardized scripts.
The unit of observation is the individual registered voter, and only those appearing on the official registration list were included. The main outcome is voter turnout in the 2005 election, while additional measures capture past voting history, party registration, demographics, and a predicted propensity to vote.

Incumbents Beware: The Impact of Offshoring on Elections,"The dataset tracks municipalities in Spain across multiple election cycles to study the effect of local offshoring events on incumbent vote shares. Offshoring events were identified using corporate balance sheet databases, prior academic compilations, media reports, and public restructuring monitors. Each event was verified through at least two independent sources to ensure accuracy.
For every confirmed event, the exact plant location and the number of jobs lost were recorded. These events were then matched with municipality-level election results to capture changes in incumbent party vote shares across elections. Additional contextual variables, such as population, unemployment, and economic growth, were obtained from official regional statistical agencies.

Does mislabeling COVID-19 elicit the perception of threat and reduce blame?,"This dataset comes from an online survey experiment conducted in the United States on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) in March 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,200 adult participants were included after excluding incomplete responses and failed manipulation checks. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a control group where the virus was labeled COVID-19 and a treatment group where it was labeled the “Chinese Virus”. The goal of the experiment was to test whether these labels influenced attitudes toward Chinese immigrants and shifted blame toward or away from the federal government. To capture sensitive views, the design combined a list experiment with direct survey questions.

The survey was conducted in two waves, before Chinese COVID-19 vaccines were available and after vaccination campaigns were being carried out extensively. In the first round, the survey gathered socio-demographic information and participants' views on the six countries. Meanwhile, the second wave contained vaccine-corrected questions, such as whether respondents had received the Chinese Covid-19 vaccine. Both surveys asked the participants' attitudes towards China and the USA.

Regression Discontinuity Designs Using Covariates,"In 1965, the U.S. government launched the Head Start program to provide financial assistance to poor families. One of its primary goals was to reduce child mortality by expanding access to essential health services. To determine eligibility for Head Start funds, county-level poverty rates were calculated using data from the 1960 census. Counties with a poverty rate greater than 59.1984 were deemed eligible to apply for grants.

Does rising income inequality affect mortality rates in advanced economies?,"This dataset aims to study the effect of income inequality on mortality rates for men and women in a subset of OECD countries from 1950 to 200 using adult mortality rates at age sixty-five as the measure of mortality. Likewise, for measuring income inequality, the inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient was used. The coefficient is directly obtained from the World Top Income Database. More specifically, the measure was derived from individual taxation and income data as well as national account statistics. The Pareto-Lorenz coefficient ranges from 1.5 to 3. Values in the range of 1.5 to 1.8 are considered low inequality, while values above 2.5 are considered high inequality.

Dismantling the “Jungle”: migrant relocation and extreme voting in France,"Data Source: This dataset combines municipal-level information from across France to study the political effects of migrant relocation after the dismantling of the Calais “Jungle” between 2015 and 2016. Data on temporary migrant reception centers, called Centres d’Accueil et d’Orientation (CAOs), were collected through a combination of systematic searches in local newspapers using Factiva and a publicly released dataset by CIMADE in October 2016. The media search recorded CAO locations and migrant counts reported in articles, while the CIMADE dataset listed 210 centers and their capacities. By merging these two sources, the final dataset includes 349 CAOs, closely matching the official government count of 365 centers. CAO capacity was measured either using the maximum number of migrants reported in media articles or the number of beds provided in the CIMADE dataset.

Does Electing Women Reduce Corruption? A Regression Discontinuity Approach,"The study aims to investigate whether there is a causal link between the share of women in office and malfeasance in Spain. In 2007, Spain's Organic Law 3/2007 on Effective Equality between Women and Men introduced mandatory gender quotas for electoral lists. The law established a 40% minimum quota requirement, mandating that political parties include at least 40% (and no more than 60%) of candidates of each sex on every electoral list.

Do Term Limits Restrain State Fiscal Policy? Approaches for Causal Inference in Assessing the Effects of Legislative Institut,"This dataset contains state-level panel data examining fiscal policy outcomes across U.S. states during a period of significant variation in legislative term limits. The data spans multiple decades, capturing the adoption and subsequent repeal of term limits across states. The term limits movement began in 1990 with California, Colorado, and Oklahoma, followed by a major wave in 1992 when eight additional states adopted restrictions. By 2000, twenty-one states had implemented term limits on state legislators. However, several states later repealed these limits through court decisions or legislative action. Currently, fifteen states maintain active term limits while six have repealed previously enacted restrictions.

Does earmarked funding affect the performance of international organisations?,"The dataset compiles performance evaluations of 32 international organizations (IOs) from 2009 to 2021, encompassing 64 assessments conducted by the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN). Organizations vary significantly in their funding composition, with some receiving predominantly core contributions that provide operational flexibility, while others rely heavily on earmarked resources that restrict fund usage to specific purposes, sectors, or geographic areas. Due to their specific nature, earmarked funding does not offer felexibility. Thus, there is a possiblility that earmarked funding may limit organizational performances. The dataset tracks both short-term and long-term earmarked funding patterns alongside core funding levels. International organizations' performance is given by two metrics: 1) Process performance, the extent to which organizations have rules to plan and manage operations strategically, and 2) outcome performance, which measures the organization's success in achieving desired results.

"Cabinets, Committees, and Careers: The Causal Effect of Committee Service","The dataset comes from French parliamentary records across multiple legislative sessions. It is structured by deputy-year, and includes variables for legislative behavior, career success, policy-making, tenure, and constituent characteristics. An interesting feature of the lower house was that the legislature was randomly assigned into 11 groups called bureaux, and each group chose members to serve on the budget committee. The deputies convened with their assigned group, and after hours of discussion, each bureau nominated three representatives to serve on the budget committee. Bureaux was a temporary committee, and the selection was done every year. This random selection of bureaux (or bureau) for budget selection was done from 1894 to 1910, after which it was disbanded.

Improving Balance in Regression Discontinuity Design by Matching: Estimating the Effect of Academic Probation after the First Year of College,"This dataset comprises comprehensive academic records from a large Canadian university system, consisting of one central campus and two smaller satellite campuses. The data tracks 12,530 first-year students who entered the university between the 1996-97 and 2003-04 academic years, with students aged 17-21 at entry. The dataset focuses on students whose academic performance places them near institutional academic standing thresholds, specifically those with first-year GPAs within a range of the university's academic evaluation criteria. Different campuses maintain distinct GPA cutoffs for academic standing assessments, resulting in variations in institutional policies across the university system. Students are placed on academic probation if their GPA falls below the cutoffs. The longitudinal structure captures academic performance across multiple terms and years, including semester and cumulative GPAs, total credits attempted and completed, registration patterns for fall and summer terms, and academic standing determinations. Outcome measures track graduation status at 4, 5, and 6-year intervals, along with probation and suspension incidents.

Deep IV: A Flexible Approach for Counterfactual Prediction,"This dataset contains simulated consumer behavior data examining relationships between pricing decisions and market demand across various emotional and temporal contexts. The data structure reflects a complex economic environment where pricing strategies may be influenced by factors that also affect consumer demand. Pricing information is represented through both continuous normalized measures and categorical indicators distinguishing between different price levels. The data captures market demand responses across various pricing scenarios, with additional variables tracking price positioning within broader market distributions.

Do Politicians Racially Discriminate Against Constituents? A Field Experiment on State Legislators,"This study utilizes randomized field experiments to examine the interactions between constituents and state legislators across the United States during October 2008. Legislators across multiple states were sent an email asking for help with the voter registration process for the primary election using black (DeShawn Jackson) or white alias names (Jake Mueller). The sender name, the legislature receiving the email, and the (hypothetical) party affiliation of the sender were randomly assigned. Not all letters included information on which political party's primary election the sender was interested in. Legislative offices were contacted through official email addresses posted on state government websites. The outcome of interest is whether the legislator responded by the November election date or not.

Countering misinformation via WhatsApp: Preliminary evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe,"The data aims to test whether trusted WhatsApp messages can counter COVID-19 misinformation in Zimbabwe. Partnering with Internews and Kubatana, the researchers crafted short weekly messages: Week 1 emphasized transmission and social distancing, Week 2 debunked fake cures. At the WhatsApp broadcast list level, timing was randomized: treatment groups received messages on Monday, control groups on Saturday.
To measure effects, a survey was sent on Thursday. Knowledge was assessed through factual questions, and behavior through a list experiment, where respondents received either a short list (only non-sensitive activities) or a long list (the same activities plus a sensitive one: visiting others during lockdown). Broadcast lists were blocked in groups of four, with random assignment across timing (treatment vs. control) and list length (short vs. long).

Voting Made Safe and Easy: The Impact of e-voting on Citizen Perceptions,"The dataset consists of individual-level responses collected during elections, focusing on voters’ experiences and perceptions of different voting systems, along with contextual details about polling stations and election workers. On election day in Salta, 1,502 voters completed a structured questionnaire: 887 used electronic voting (e-voting), while the remainder voted with paper ballots. A total of 36 polling stations were sampled to reflect comparable socio-economic conditions.
Participants were recruited using gender and age quotas, with the questionnaire tailored to their voting method. Additional information came from election workers and independent observers. The study assessed voter confidence in the process, views on secrecy and transparency, ease and speed of voting, poll worker qualifications, and preferences for electronic versus traditional voting—particularly within Argentina’s split-ticket system. To facilitate interpretation, ordinal responses were recoded into binary indicators distinguishing positive from negative experiences across key outcomes: satisfaction, poll worker competence, ease and speed, candidate selection, confidence in counting, secrecy, and perceived election integrity.
